# Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck and Monster Class Architecture Exercise

Welcome to the Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck and Monster Class Architecture Exercise. This project aims to establish a foundational 
class structure for a card game based on the popular "Yu-Gi-Oh!" series by late Kazuki Takahashi. Below are the
specifications for your implementation.

## Specifications

### Monsters

In "Yu-Gi-Oh!", there are two types of monster cards:

- Main Deck Monsters
- Extra Deck Monsters

Each type of monster belongs in its respective deck. You will NOT implement the monster classes in this exercise.

### Decks

There are two decks where the monsters can be played:

- Main Deck
- Extra Deck

You must implement functionality for both decks. The provided `Deck` trait will serve as the base for your deck
implementations.

### Tasks

1. **Implement Deck Interface:**
    - Utilize the provided `Deck` trait to implement two classes: `MainDeck` and `ExtraDeck`.
    - Ensure that only the appropriate type of monster can be added to each deck.

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
    - Use TDD to guide the development of your classes.
    - Write tests before implementing the functionalities to ensure that your code meets all the requirements.

3. **Project Structure:**
    - Your project should be well-structured, with separate packages for different components.
    - Properly organize your classes and traits within these packages.
    - You can move the provided code to a separate package if you wish.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Provide a UML diagram showcasing the class structure of your implementation.
   - Include comments in your code to explain the purpose of each class and method, use the provided code as a
     reference.
    
## Provided Code

```scala
class Card(val name: String) {
   override def toString: String = s"Card(name='$name')"

   override def equals(obj: Any): Boolean = if (obj.isInstanceOf[Card]) {
      val other = obj.asInstanceOf[Card]
      name == other.name
   } else {
      false
   }

   override def hashCode(): Int = Objects.hash(classOf[Card].hashCode(), name)
}

trait Deck {
   val size: Int
   val cards: List[Card]

   def draw: (Card, Deck)

   def shuffled: Deck

   def search(name: String): Option[Card]

   def addCard(card: Card): Deck

   def removeCard(name: String): Deck
}

```

You cannot modify the provided code. You must implement your classes based on the provided traits.

## Deliverables

- A UML diagram showcasing the class structure of your implementation.
- The source code for your implementation.

## Note

Remember to listen to the heart of the cards.
